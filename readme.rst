Ultra-Fast Force Fields (UF3)
=============================

|Tests|

All-atom dynamics simulations have become an indispensable quantitative
tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science, but large systems and
long simulation times remain challenging due to the trade-off between
computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. The UF3 framework is
built to address this challenge by combinining effective two- and
three-body potentials in a cubic B-spline basis with regularized linear
regression to obtain machine-learning potentials that are physically
interpretable, sufficiently accurate for applications, and as fast as
the fastest traditional empirical potentials.

This repository is still under construction. Please feel free to open
new issues for feature requests and bug reports.

Setup
-----

.. code:: bash

   conda create --name uf3_env python=3.7
   conda activate uf3_env
   git clone https://github.com/sxie22/uf3
   cd uf3
   pip install wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install numba
   pip install -e .

Getting Started
---------------

Please see the examples in examples/tungsten_extxyz and examples/NeXe_lammps for basic usage.

Overviews for individual modules can be found in examples/modules
(WIP).

Standalone scripts and configuration generators/parsers are in
development.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

Elastic constants:

::

   pip install setuptools_scm
   pip install "elastic>=5.1.0.17"

Phonon spectra:

::

   pip install spglib
   pip install seekpath
   pip install "phonopy>=2.6.0"

LAMMPS interface:

::

   conda install numpy==1.20.3 --force-reinstall
   conda install -c conda-forge lammps --no-update-deps

Dependencies
------------

-  We rely on ase to handle parsing outputs from atomistic codes like
   LAMMPS, VASP, and C2PK.
-  We use Pandas to keep track of atomic configurations and their
   energies/forces as well as organizing data for featurization and
   training.
-  B-spline evaluations use scipy, numba, and ndsplines.
-  PyTables is used for reading/writing HDF5 files.

Citing This Work
----------------

The manuscript is still in preparation.
